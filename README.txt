I/ Require
	Customers enter zipcode
	The system searches and displays information about products with the best prices in 3 depots within 300 miles.
	1.	A customer goes to strongcontainers.com – they enter their zip code (postal code) and click enter.
	a. Our new system that you are building searches for the best TOTAL price (for the container item and the shipping price combined) from the nearest 2 depots.    
	The customer clicks a button that says PAY NOW or COD (some markets we allow COD delivery – this means we allow them to pay when we arrive to their house with the container they want to purchase)
	a.	When they click PAY NOW it takes them to a secure page where they can enter their credit card information.  (An E-Commerce page) he order has now been placed and it shows up in our Strong Containers Administrative system (our back end website) 4. The order shows up on the administrative site for us to do the following:
         a. Assign a container from our inventory of containers. Assign a driver from a list of drivers that do deliveries for us in that city. Administrative system? Or from other website
      6. The next step is to ask the customer when we can deliver.   We need to be able to send text messages in the system to the customer.
    7.  DRIVERS – we need to have a calendar page that has AM (morning) and PM (afternoon) deliveries.   Drivers deliver 2 containers per day.  We assign the customer order to the driver and then we send the request for the driver to click ACCEPT from their phone or computer.
